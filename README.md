# Tiny-LSTM-Weather-Station
This project uses historical weather data of a specific location (Lo Barnechea, Chile) to train a model to predict its future temperature. The trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model will be converted with TensorFlow Lite- Micro to be deployed on a microcontroller. The prediction will be tested using an XIAO ESP32S3.
